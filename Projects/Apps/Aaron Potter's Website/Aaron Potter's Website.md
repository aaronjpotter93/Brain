# What is the target audience looking for

I want my website to be more then my portfolio. I want it to be very easy for people who visit my site to find what they are looking for. if i have my website linked to my resume then it should take them straight to my portfolio. but that is just one page. and that page should be designed to answer their questions, and if some of the questions they have stray from my "professional details" into "who is this guy" then i can route them to the other part of my website that answers that question but still from the angle of its an employer looking to answer that question.
