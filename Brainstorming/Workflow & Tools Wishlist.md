## Considerations
Systems of tooling for learning, building, exploring threads of thought, and recalling them quickly depend on a solid strategy for mapping ideas to mediums that feel representative of the ideas and their relationships. The mind navigates patterns in many ways—forward and backward—mirroring the nuances of data structures and their scaling rules. When designing a system for recalling ideas, redundancy might be necessary to accommodate the brain’s diverse recollection tools. This ensures the "trailhead" to an idea can start from multiple points, depending on the context. Some paths the mind might take include:

- **Location**
    
- **Alphabetic**
    
- **Time**
    
- **Category**
    
- **Hierarchical**
    

Data wrangling—consuming, organizing, and applying knowledge—becomes more time-consuming when reliant on manual and cognitive maintenance. The brain, the most sophisticated data management system, stores long-term information in areas beyond conscious cognition, relying heavily on automation. (I realize I’m making many assumptions here—time for some Descartes' [systematic doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_doubt#:~:text=Cartesian%20doubt%20is%20a%20systematic,the%20possibility%20of%20certain%20knowledge.)) The brain’s goal is to minimize the need for conscious decision-making by automating predictable processes, reducing cognitive load. Think of any time you’ve mindlessly completed a task—that’s automation at work. If a task doesn’t require critical thinking and the integrity of the system depends on it, that task should be automated. This is why it’s critical for tooling to minimize manual maintenance: it pulls the mind away from spaces where critical thinking and intuition thrive.

A system that serves the mind’s desire to explore ideas and information—one that improves at keeping up, tracking progress, and resuming where it left off—requires personalized automation.

My task is to find a combination of integrated tools that improve over time. I want a system that redefines itself, adapts, and sheds inefficiencies. Tooling lock-in is not an option, as it would limit adaptability. At the same time, I must rely on existing tools to avoid getting lost in the weeds of low-level thinking. The enablement of higher level abstraction is the aim.
