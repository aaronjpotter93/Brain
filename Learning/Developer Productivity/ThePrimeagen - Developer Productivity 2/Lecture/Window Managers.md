## The most important aspect

Is navigation.

> You should never need your mouse or search with your eyes for your most common operations

This is how i think of my navigation:

1. 99.5% of things i do consistently, turn that into 1 to 2 buttons being pressed
2. 0.5% of things i do from time to time and i am ok using a mouse

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## The window manager

One of the most powerful things you can use is a window manager because it takes care of one of the most annoying facets of computers. Placing windows

If you are still placing windows manually, you are living in the stone age.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## Window managers

This will not be a large part of the course, but this will be the basis for how I approach everything from here on out.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## What is a window manager?

This will really depend on the window manager you use.

- pop os
- i3
- awesomewm
- leftwm
- yabai (mac)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## The strategy I employ

So there are many strategies you can employ, but here is the way I got about using a window manager.

1. focus
2. one key to where i need

  
  

Let me get out ol gimp to show you what what i mean

- the complexity of mac desktops and navigation
- one one key matters

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## Opening programs

Another thing that windows and mac users have pretty much for free is a nice search bar for opening programs. Apple's Spotlight pretty much gets you what you want asap.

For linux, there is `rofi`, `dmenu`, and likely 100 more (its linux afterall)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## I don't give any recs

Notice that i am not giving any recommendations here. I just don't think it matters. I don't see how you using AwsomeWM is going to make much of a difference with my workflow as using i3.

Now if i used more features, such as more than one window at a time in desktop I may need to explore more and come up with "better" solutions. But at this point, for me it makes no difference.
