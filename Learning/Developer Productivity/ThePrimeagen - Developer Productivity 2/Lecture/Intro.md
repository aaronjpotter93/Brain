## Supercharging your dev life

One of the best ways to dramatically increase the speed of what you are doing is learning the posix ways and some of the tools out there to massively improve your life

  
  

I cannot tell you how many times in my earlier life i wrote a program that one small line of bash could have taken care of for me. Just knowing your tools is a massive advantage in developer life.

  
  

Another reality of dev'ing is that for a while a single tool will be so useful, then you wont use it again for months. This has been my relationship with jq. Its ok, you will forget the practical part, but you wont forget what you can do as you learn these tools.
