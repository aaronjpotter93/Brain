> `brew` is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS and Linux.

- List all installed packages:
```bash
brew list
```
> it would be cool if my code blocks here could have a run button which emulates whatever is needed in order to execute and a console window attatches to the bottom of obsidian or the active pain and outputs the results. that'd be cool.
- List only explicitly installed apps (not dependencies):
```bash
brew leaves
```
