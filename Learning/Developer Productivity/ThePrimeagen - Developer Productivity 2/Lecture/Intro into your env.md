## The Environment

So for me, when i say environment what i mean is everything surrounding the development process.  
  

How you install your favorite libraries  
How you interact with your operating system to get you where you want to be  
How you arrange your windows  
How you arrange your screens (desktops?)  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## The most important starting place

If you were given a brand new system how long does it take you set up? I would venture that most people spend a day getting ready to go followed by another couple days patching the holes.
