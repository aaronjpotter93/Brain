## This may get offensive

I don't really care what terminal you use. I use Ghostty, its fast, and its created by someone I respect. That is it. Its really that simple.

- I get to chose my own colorscheme easily with ghostty
- I move on because all my customizations are at a different level

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## Why Not?

Alacritty - I was using it, now i am not Kitty - Provides more terminal experiences closer to tmux, but the owner is exceptionally unpleasant, so i wont use it. Ghostty - Provides everything Alactritty does but its by Mitchell! Xterm-256color - I used this for so long. The only reason i upgraded to a gpu accellerated term was so i could run ascii doom in 30 fps at "high resolution." Wezterm - I heard this one can make it so i don't have to use tmux anymore. Thats pretty neet. Maybe one day i'll give it a try
