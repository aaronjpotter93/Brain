## Mind Dump:
This structure actually probably should be replaced by a kanban

### Versioning Convention 
```md
Format explanation:
v{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{pre-release}.{number}

Where:
- 0: Major version (0 indicates pre-release/initial development)
- 1: Minor version (new features)
- 0: Patch version (bug fixes)
- alpha: Pre-release identifier
- 1: Build number for this phase
```


### Phases
#### Phase 1: Set Up Project
Goal: Just get something working and deployed that shows I have a server app that is successfully connected to s3, and taking advantage of free tier offerings such as beanstalk/ configured correctly and securely, makes use of docker for containerization and easy versioning for ci/cd later.

##### Features:
- one page:
	- lists bucket objects
	- size of bucket and remaining space (of staying in free tier eligibility)
##### Stack:
- spring boot
- thymleaf
- s3
- docker
- beanstalk

##### Steps:
- [x] create project
- [x] configure classes to interact with s3
- [x] build controller (and maybe service but these two features are very light in complexity)
- [x] build thymleaf template to display these two features

##### Structure
```bash
// Start with this basic structure
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java/
