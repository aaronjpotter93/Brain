When a file is created you can skip the title creation, and linking, and tagging. each new file is fed through an llm who has a couple tasks as well as the context of the vault contents and current tagging conventions. The user gets straight to the content they want to get down and as they do the llm is pouring over the changes to try and predict useful things such as:
- The title the note should be called
- The meta data that should be associated with the file's yml front matter
- The tags and the tags hierarchy
- points in the document that may be referring to other notes and, provide links to them. (you know how in an ide code editor, if a method or variable or object is in scope and you start typing out characters that match that pattern, the ide helps you by suggesting them to finish filling out as well as points to the correct object. that but for notes(notes can be equivalent to classes, folders equivalent to modules or packages ect..))

I want to reduce the friction that exists between getting an idea out of my head and onto paper and into a CI/CD pipeline, and in such a way that is easily tracked for where it fits if it does with everything else in the vault. I want it to be a place where ideas can quickly be converted to their role, such as, is this an idea for the type of note(objects in code have types too and inheritance) that will be useful as reference when revisiting the problem or similar problems, or is the idea more of a vision, a plan that builds off of or is very closely related to previous design ideas. is this idea something i need to do. or is this idea shedding greater light on a task i already have set out to do. or do i need to log events as they happened with as much detail as is accessible to me. or do i want to take notes about something i'm learning, where hopefully the context of the learning and the tools used are aware of each other and my note can distill those details and organize them in a way fitting to the structure of the vault and the ways i would want to find that information again. if i'm in an ide code editor working on a project, could my vault be aware of that? and have possibly relavent information in memory, ready to be called on when i forget how i format an mvc response to a specific kind of request for example. could i much more easily explore more about a coding principle that wasnt necessary or ingrained when i last dove into it, but in the problem im trying to solve currently would make it easy to pull up the official documentation of the package or class i'm working with and how it interatcts with something i didn't interact with before but now am trying to build for.

I want to reduce the friction of all these activities. learning, recalling, building, deploying. the places that I have gone in abstraction, the places i am at in abstraction, and the places I want to go(fresh and new or breathing new life into the systems i've been building or built).
