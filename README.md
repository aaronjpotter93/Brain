# Brain Vault: A Living Knowledge Compiler  
**Mission:** *To create an antifragile second brain that evolves with my cognitive workflows while maintaining operational clarity across domains.*  

*"The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled."* - Plutarch (adapted for the digital age)

## Domain Architecture  
### Core Mental States  
| **Seedling** (💡) | **Cultivating** (🌱) | **Harvest** (🚀) |

| Raw ideas         | Active development    | Deployed systems  |
| `/Brainstorming`  | `/Integrating`        | `/Projects`       |
| Unstructured      | Prototypes            | Production-ready  |

## Technical Foundations  
### Cognitive Automation Suite  
```python  
# Sample CLI Thought Integrator  
def capture_idea(idea, domain="General", urgency=3):  
    timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()  
    with open(f"{DOMAINS[domain]}/{timestamp}.md", "w") as f:  
        f.write(f"# {idea}\nUrgency: {'⚠️'*urgency}")  
    sync_with_tasks(idea, domain)  # Connect to Todoist/ClickUp  
```

### Immutable Infrastructure  
```nix  
# NixOS configuration snippet  
{ pkgs, ... }: {  
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [  
    obsidian  
    (python3.withPackages (ps: [ps.numpy ps.transformers]))  
  ];  
  system.autoUpgrade.enable = true;  # Keep knowledge tools fresh  
}  
```
