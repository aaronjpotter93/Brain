## Why no AI?

there are two important reasons why i didn't go over AI in this course.

1. i see this rise of behavior in devs "learned helplessness"
2. the products are just moving so fast

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## And this is it

Its the joy of making a better experience that helps keep me engaged as a dev.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## Important note

The most important thing about this course is not to do what I do, but to do what _you_ want to do. Now I emphasized the most important tools you can get familiar with and their variations. Learn, enjoy, and figure out what you want.
