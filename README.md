# Mission of this Vault
>There needs to be an easy way to tell between the different domains of thought that goes into what this vault represents. 

## Domains
>it would be so cool if there was an actual console query plugin....... like i type something like 
```consoleview
tree ./
%% Which would run the actual command in an emulated console and in the current location of the file and return to  markdown the string results to render %%
```

> And that :LiArrowBigUpDash: is an example of domains. Theres an attempt to define things below :LiArrowBigDownDash: and then I had an idea that reinvents the way i'm doing the shiz i'm doing. This vault will contain both states and more but there needs to be a way to quickly tell what is what, also so that I can know where to go quickly when I have an idea that affects other areas. I will be revisiting this vault on a daily basis coming here from different points of view and different needs, all touching on specific domain states, and if i can't tell what something is for, the value of that domain may be lost if the new approach to that area comes at it in a way that feels like I need to traverse stale and or abandoned workflow/framework solutions. 
> one of the biggest pain points that i want to address in the foundations i'm laying out for my personal knowledge base management is how can the reinvention of nearly every minute implementation of every area and domain not be so disruptive to the process of moving forward. naturally between the dreaming and the doing, they both have a place and I want to do both. is it possible to build a system that I can confidenlty lean heavily on (entirely aware of how likely the whole thing will change, but that ideas for reinvention and the conventions will still serve a purpose but not dig out a deeper and deeper whole for me to need to maintain or eventually autoupsy for starting systems from scratch which i never want to have to do with the amount of value that exists in the systems i use, or if i do need to start from scratch that the bringing forward all the value of the old system is not so disruptive of a process either. the point is to have a system that helps me move forward with making things happen in domains and areas that matter to me, and having a system that can evolve with those changing needs. nothing exists out there that will give me that, i have to build it. but i want to know of what convensions and technollogy exist out there to meet this second brain system. what to expect out of the process getting there and how to move toward it in such a way that it doesnt become all consuming, because i need to do the things that i came here for, like making my way through course material, investing in career search related activies, building and integrating the things I am learning from classes and so on)

I need to tell the difference between what purpose and thinking goes into types of directories and file types:
## Domain Types:
### Learning
- Note taking on course content
### Integrating
- Extracurricular activities where I try and apply what I'm learning to my own life, workflow, tooling
### Doing:
- Task Management
- Timeline Views
### 
>It kind of feels like theres a bit of a progression of things.. in the future maybe the system should operate similar to the flow of things from infancy stages to end domains where it comes to life in the real world or theres no end but a trail of where things lead in their infancy to learning and integrating where new abstract ideas entered and in their infancy where did that lead? how can i make use of this technology to build a framework, with automation and templates and scripting that every makes it easier to move through these domains and maintain threads. is that possible if the framework constantly evolves and breaks conventions in pursuits of better representing the desires of my brain muscles. Maybe its possible with the future that ai is going in especiallly if i pursue a masters in ai, i could bring into every layer, stage of life of the vault to make use of fractured evolving frameworks to meet the desires I ever change and grow in some how.

Take a look at the directory below of the career area. can you tell what here is what in terms of domain states? what purpose each of these serve? and how can this be reimagined to better suit clearly understanding of what happens here? should there be a system implemented where at the file explorer level icons or naming conventions are used to tell at a glance where i need to go with the thoughts i'm having and content that I continue to create? maybe make use of moc files that query properties of content under a folder to make it easier to see the use of them by way of the contents and content format of the files within?
