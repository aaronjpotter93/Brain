When a file is created, depending on where or how it is created, the template will change.


"For metadata, using YAML frontmatter with required fields. Templater can prompt for input when creating a note. For example, creating a Learning Note would ask for topic, related projects, key concepts."

the creating of a new note for learning that prompts the user for topic, related project, key concepts, should be automated as well, in that all i have to do is provide the learning material resource and based on the content of that resource, it can derive what the topics are, what the related projects are, key concepts and so on. maybe this could be achieved through the use of a specialized ai model with this task, to take resources used in a study session, and provide back relevant information for the template about it and then the functions build to take that information populates the yaml, the tags, and the links as well as the backlinks. all this so that i can get right to the study, and have already at my fingertips the references i need for that topic, quick idea dumps to brainstorming and back again, task adds for projects that are relevant, and back again, and so on. 

for quite some time i want less goals oriented around what my idea of a project could be at the time of setting the goal, because the path to that is never in line with the reality of the path i take to get there, without experience in a given space, i can't approach self driven projects, and learning like a project manager does, because they have different end goals even though they deceivingly relate on the goal of having a product, my goal differs in that, i'm not beholden to a client's needs and timeline, i'm also putting a much higher value in quality time spent learning, practicing, and reinforcing ideas, that will ebb and flow between projects, so its much more important to me that i map my learning and build a portfolio of skills and knowledge, not brute force an app that most likely won't actually be of any value to me or my portfolio. so goal setting and project management to me will look more like, within my day today what will i spend time learning, and whats important to me is that this process is enabled by a system that can reduce the friction of configuration as much as possible ( i want to over engineer the shit out of this system) so that I can pour my energy into learning, and that that learning and playing and building can not be bogged down by the shier amount of manual work that goes into maintaining and evolving a system as complex as this. ( i do however expect there to be a great amount of energy, time and friction in setting it up though which i'm happy to invest if it means my future endeavors will be rewarded)
